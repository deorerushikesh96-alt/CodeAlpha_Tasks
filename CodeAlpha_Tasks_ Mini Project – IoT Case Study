## 1. Introduction

The rapid growth of urban population has created major challenges for cities, such as traffic congestion, pollution, energy management, water scarcity, waste disposal, and public safety. Traditional city management systems are often inefficient, manual, and unable to respond in real time. To overcome these challenges, the concept of **Smart Cities** has emerged.

A Smart City uses **Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)**, especially the **Internet of Things (IoT)**, to improve the quality of life of citizens, optimize resource usage, and ensure sustainable development. IoT enables physical devices such as sensors, actuators, cameras, and smart meters to connect to the internet and share data automatically.

This case study focuses on the **future of IoT in Smart Cities**, highlighting its architecture, key applications, benefits, challenges, and future trends.
